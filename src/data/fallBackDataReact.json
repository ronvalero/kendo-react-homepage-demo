I'm mainly talking about the latest `alpha` versions that include React Hooks. I noticed from NPM that a new `next` was available under `16.8.0-alpha.0` and I went to the repository here to understand what had changed from `16.7.0-alpha.2` that I was using, however, didn't find any mention of this release on the \"Releases\" section. I had to go through closed PRs to understand that #14555 was the PR that did the change and was published.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Please close if this has already been considered.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI tweeted about this:\r\n1. https://twitter.com/tazsingh/status/1083314900586373120\r\n2. https://twitter.com/tazsingh/status/1083329402308562944\r\n\r\nIn essence, Hooks require a full execution of a Component function to register. However, Suspense interrupts that execution such that Hooks aren't able to effectively register. As such, it's impossible to rely on the output of any Hooks until all suspended calls are resolved.\r\n\r\nSince the vision for Suspense is to use them as the primary async mechanism in React and since Hooks are meant to be composable items within a Component, where it isn't strictly important to be aware of what is contained in a Hook for it to be useful, I can see this as problematic if they cannot register properly because some other Hook has suspended.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

I also describe a related behaviour in my second tweet regarding usage of `useMemo`.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/9y64nmkrzy\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nFrankly, I am unsure of the expected behaviour as I believe both of these features to be working as intended hence why I titled this issue as a \"question\". I am aware that I am using these features before they are released and proper communication of the usage between Hooks + Suspense is not yet available.\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behaviour, cool üëç If not, I am happy to file a bug report accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

With the latest version of react 16.7.0 our app (which uses Suspense and Lazy) doesn't load all the needed js chunks. You need to navigate around the app to request other js chunks and eventually the app is fully loaded.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nWe have a routes.js file with all the routes of the app. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Organisation = lazy(() => import('./pages/Organisation'));\r\nconst Services = lazy(() => import('./pages/Services'));\r\n// all the other dynamic imports go here\r\n// ...\r\nconst Page404 = lazy(() => import('./pages/Page404'));\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default (\r\n  <ErrorBoundary>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span />}>\r\n      <Switch>\r\n        <Redirect exact from=\"/\" to=\"/organisation\" />\r\n        <Route path=\"/organisation\" component={Organisation} />\r\n        <Route path=\"/services\" component={Services} />\r\n              <!-- All the other routes -->\r\n        <Route path=\"*\" component={Page404} />\r\n      </Switch>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  </ErrorBoundary>\r\n);\r\n```\r\nThe route \"/\" is redirected to \"/organisation\" which returns the \"Organisation\" component. However, the Organisation component is not rendered, the chunk hasn't been requested on demand. If we navigate to \"/services\" the services chunk is requested on demand and loaded well. Then, if we go back to \"/organisation\" all is fine.\r\n\r\nThere are no shown errors at all. \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe js chunks are requested on demand loaded and the components are rendered when we initially load the app.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis worked in all previous version of React that we tried since Lazy and Suspense was released in 16.3.0\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.7.0\r\nOS: Win7\r\nBrowser: IE11",

Now my problem is: Given a Fiber node of `Suspense`, how could we know the loading status of `Suspense` so I can make sure whether (1) the module is loaded successfully loaded (or failed) and (2) React has rendered (or not rendered) the new component tree?\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the implementation detail of Fiber and I'm still trying to investigate into this. That would be great if someone familiar with this could answer. Thanks!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

However, **using this library** is displaying this error:\r\n\r\n> Invariant Violation: Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component\r\n\r\nCodesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/znx2r55lkp\r\n\r\nAlthough the error says that it can only be called inside the body of a function component, is already on the body...\r\n\r\nOriginal library code: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction Form(props) {\r\n  const onSubmitForm = useCallback(event => {\r\n    event.preventDefault()\r\n    event.stopPropagation()\r\n\r\n    const { onSubmit = () => {} } = props\r\n    const fields = Array.prototype.slice.call(event.target)\r\n      .filter(field => field.name)\r\n      .reduce((form, { name, value }) => ({\r\n        ...form,\r\n        [name]: typeof value === 'string'\r\n          ? value.trim()\r\n          : value,\r\n      }), {})\r\n\r\n    onSubmit(fields)\r\n  }, [])\r\n  const { children } = props\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form {...props} onSubmit={onSubmitForm}>\r\n      {children}\r\n    </form>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Input(props) {\r\n  const { label, name } = props\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <label htmlFor={name}>\r\n      <div>{label}</div>\r\n      <input\r\n        {...props}\r\n        id={name}\r\n        name={name}\r\n      />\r\n    </label>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  Form, Input,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the beginning I thought that was for the Babel transpilation. Nevertheless, running a codesandbox using the transpiled code instead of the library, is working well:\r\n\r\n* https://codesandbox.io/s/k0j6zn2xzo\r\n\r\nDowngrading these versions in the project that use the library, it works:\r\n\r\n* **react** -> from 16.8.0-alpha.0 -> to 16.7.0-alpha.2\r\n* **react-dom:** from 16.8.0-alpha.0 -> to 16.7.0-alpha.2\r\n\r\nSo looks that for some reason with 16.8.0-alpha.0 is not compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n> **Note**: Perhaps is not an issue and is something that I'm doing wrong...

(Using symbolic links seems literally unacceptable.)\r\n\r\nIt seems not unreasonable to think you should be able to use your platform/IDEs of choice and have the UNIX VM mount and work of those NFS Mounted files. The way all this stuff is build falls short of this I call expected behaviors. \r\n\r\nThe only problems are why isn't 'npm start' able to run 'npx react-scripts start', and in turn why does that not understand the package is already built and take forever to rebuild all packages every time? I think it also relates to file watching. Maybe there is a way to deploy this without waiting 10 minutes to launch a simple example.\r\n",

I'm having some doubts about React's advice on [Building My Own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).\r\n\r\nDocumentations tells me that,\r\n\r\n> A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with \"use\" and that may call other Hooks.\r\n\r\nSo the idea I get is that, if I were to write an NPM package exporting a custom hook, I have to export a function and add React as a dependency to my package. Let's take a couple of examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Example 01 (from https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html):\r\nconst [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);\r\n\r\nfunction handleStatusChange(status) {\r\n    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n    return () => {\r\n        ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Example 02 (detect user pressing escape key):\r\nfunction handleEscapeKey (e) {\r\n    if (e.key === 'Escape') { /* do something with escape key */ }\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleEscapeKey);\r\n    return () => {\r\n        window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleEscapeKey);\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if I were to create two NPM packages for these, I would first import React as a dependency,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then implement the packages in this manner:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Example 01:\r\nexport function useFriendStatus(friendID) {\r\n    const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);\r\n    \r\n    function handleStatusChange(status) {\r\n        setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n        return () => {\r\n            ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n        };\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    return isOnline;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Example 02\r\nexport function useWindowKeydown(handler) {\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        window.addEventListener('keydown', handler);\r\n        return () => {\r\n            window.removeEventListener('keydown', handler);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel that these packages are trying to do too much. For example,\r\n\r\n - In the first example the custom hook is initializing the state, which may be better done by a component.\r\n - Also, why do they both have to be aware about React. They are both trying to abstract away a pair of subscribe/unsubscribe functions.\r\n\r\nRather, we could export just the functionality we are trying to abstract away. And if we need any state or state-setters, we can pass them as arguments.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Example 01: package `hook-friend-status`\r\nexport function hookFriendStatus(friendId, handleStatusChange) {\r\n    return () => {\r\n        ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n        return () => {\r\n            ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Example 02: package `hook-window-keydown`\r\nexport function hookWindowKeydown(handler) {\r\n    return () => {\r\n        window.addEventListener('keydown', handler);\r\n        return () => {\r\n            window.removeEventListener('keydown', handler);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then we can use it inside our component in the following manner:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\r\nimport hookFriendStatus from 'hook-friend-status';\r\nimport hookWindowKeydown from 'hook-window-keydown';\r\n\r\nfunction MyAwesomeComponent ({ friendId }) {\r\n    const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(\r\n        // component can decide how to initialize state.\r\n        false\r\n    );\r\n    function handleStatusChange(status) {\r\n        setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\r\n    }\r\n    useEffect(hookFriendStatus(friendId, handleStatusChange));\r\n    \r\n    function handleEscapeKey (e) {\r\n        if (e.key === 'Escape') { /* do something with escape key */ }\r\n    }\r\n    useEffect(hookWindowKeydown(handleEscapeKey));\r\n\r\n    return (/** jsx */)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this way is much cleaner:\r\n\r\n - The concerns are separated better.\r\n - Packages/libraries don't have to be aware of React (which also means these libraries can be used outside React as well).\r\n - I would presume it will be easier to test the packages/libraries, because they are not calling react hooks (less mocking).\r\n - Linter can stop searching after they scanned the component, so could the humans when doing the code review.\r\n\r\nIt might be a premature judgement that I have reached, as we are yet to see what people are exactly doing with hooks. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks.",

This does not allow for importing named imports from a module. \r\n\r\nThe official workaround, according to [the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#named-exports):\r\n\r\n> If the module you want to import uses named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default.\r\n\r\nAnother, [more concise workaround](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14390#issuecomment-444494386):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Contacts = React.lazy(() =>\r\n  import('./Contacts.js').then(module => ({ default: module.Contacts }))\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the proposed behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to submit a PR that optionally accepts named imports but defaults to importing the default import. It would look like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nthenable.then(\r\n-  moduleObject => {\r\n+  resolvedComponent => {\r\n    if (lazyComponent._status === Pending) {\r\n-      const defaultExport = moduleObject.default;\r\n+      if (resolvedComponent.default) {\r\n+        resolvedComponent = resolvedComponent.default\r\n+      }\r\n      if (__DEV__) {\r\n-        if (defaultExport === undefined) {\r\n+        if (resolvedComponent === undefined) {\r\n          warning(\r\n            false,\r\n-            'lazy: Expected the result of a dynamic import() call. ' +\r\n+            'lazy: Expected a promise that resolves to a React component. ' +\r\n              'Instead received: %s\\n\\nYour code should look like: \\n  ' +\r\n              \"const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'))\",\r\n-            moduleObject,\r\n+            resolvedComponent,\r\n          );\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      lazyComponent._status = Resolved;\r\n-      lazyComponent._result = defaultExport;\r\n+      lazyComponent._result = resolvedComponent;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  error => {\r\n    if (lazyComponent._status === Pending) {\r\n      lazyComponent._status = Rejected;\r\n      lazyComponent._result = error;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will also require some updates to the docs.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts before I start...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

E.g.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(5);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  // Hand off setValue somewhere\r\n}, [setValue]); // ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm wondering what the exact validity guarantees are around the setters returned by `useState()` or the dispatch functions returned by `useReducer()`. According to the docs, the dispatch function returned by `useReducer()` shouldn't change between re-renders, so it shouldn't be necessary to include it in the 2nd argument of these hooks. `useState()` seems to use `useReducer()` internally, so the same is possibly true for it. Is it officially guaranteed that any setter returned by `useState()` remains valid until the component unmounts?",

                            "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a very weird memory leak that seems to be related to componentDidMount declaration. Memory is not freed after unmounting component.\r\n\r\n### Used code\r\nVersion: react 16.7\r\nMode: developper or production (same behaviour)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code I use to hide or display a list of items  \r\n```\r\nclass Item extends React.Component {\r\n     componentDidMount() {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n      render() {\r\n            return <div>test item</div>;\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Items extends React.Component {\r\n      constructor(props) {\r\n            super(props);\r\n            this.state =  {};\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      renderList() {\r\n            let items = [];\r\n            for(var i = 0; i < 4000; i++) {\r\n                  items.push( <Item key={i} />);\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            return items;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      onDisplay = ()=>{\r\n            this.setState({display: true});\r\n      }\r\n      onHide = ()=>{\r\n            this.setState({display: false});\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      render() {      \r\n            return <div>\r\n                  <div key=\"display\" onClick={this.onDisplay}>Display</div>\r\n                  <div key=\"hide\" onClick={this.onHide}>Hide</div>\r\n                  {this.state.display ? this.renderList() : null}\r\n            </div>\r\n      }\r\n}\r\nReactDOM.render(<Items />, document.getElementById(\"app\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCASE 1\r\nUse google chrome and display the performance monitor to study JS Heap size and Dom Nodes.\r\n1) Click on display => the list of 4000 items is displayed\r\n2) Click on \"hide\" => the list is unmounted\r\nWhen you look at performance monitor, you can see that around 8000 nodes are still in memory (and JS Heap is higher than before mounting components as well).\r\nIf you redo 1) and 2) multiple times, you will see nodes going to 16000 then going back to 8000, ... etc.\r\n\r\nThus, memory is freed after the first unmount operation, but the first one is not. The weird thing is that if you do 1), 2), 2), 2), then it is freed.\r\n\r\nCASE 2\r\nUse the same code but remove the \"componentDidMount\" function in the class.\r\nDo 1) and 2), then after few secondes memory is freed automatically (nodes and js heap)  => expected behaviour\r\n\r\n### Behaviour expected\r\n\r\nI was expected that the memory would be freed after unmounting a component, like in the 2nd case. That's a real issue when you mount.unmount big list multiple times, then js heap is going very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also seemingly randomly it works for some and doesn't for others. Would be great to get a general recommendation / fix.\r\n\r\nMy use case:\r\n\r\n`MyComponent` above is a simple `styled-component` (`styled.ul`).\r\n\r\nThe issue seem to be related to versions or version mismatches between `react`, `react-dom` and `react-test-renderer`. In my case, the error disappears locally by having `v16.5.0` install of all. However, the issue still occurs in GitLab CI. The only obvious difference is that the CI uses `yarn` and I use `npm`. **I was finally able to solve it in both environments by upgrading all three to the latest, `v16.7.0`.** Having any minor version mismatches seemed to reproduce the error locally.\r\n\r\nComplete trace of error:\r\n```\r\n      at invariant (node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:55:15)\r\n      at findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath (node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:4125:30)\r\n      at findCurrentHostFiber (node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:4233:23)\r\n      at findHostInstanceWithWarning (node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:19454:21)\r\n      at Object.findDOMNode (node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:19962:14)\r\n      at StyledComponent.componentDidMount (node_modules/styled-components/dist/styled-components.cjs.js:1927:25)\r\n      at commitLifeCycles (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:7019:22)\r\n      at commitAllLifeCycles (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:8234:7)\r\n      at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:2312:14)\r\n      at invokeEventListeners (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/events/EventTarget-impl.js:193:27)\r\n      at HTMLUnknownElementImpl._dispatch (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/events/EventTarget-impl.js:119:9)\r\n      at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.dispatchEvent (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/events/EventTarget-impl.js:82:17)\r\n      at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.dispatchEvent (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/nodes/HTMLElement-impl.js:30:27)\r\n      at HTMLUnknownElement.dispatchEvent (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/generated/EventTarget.js:157:21)\r\n      at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:2362:16)\r\n      at invokeGuardedCallback (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:2411:31)\r\n      at commitRoot (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:8404:7)\r\n      at completeRoot (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9769:3)\r\n      at performWorkOnRoot (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9697:9)\r\n      at performWork (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9601:7)\r\n      at performSyncWork (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9573:3)\r\n      at requestWork (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9461:5)\r\n      at scheduleWork (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9256:5)\r\n      at scheduleRootUpdate (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9865:3)\r\n      at updateContainerAtExpirationTime (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9892:10)\r\n      at updateContainer (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:9903:10)\r\n      at Object.create (node_modules/react-test-renderer/cjs/react-test-renderer.development.js:10428:5)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/components/Selectors/DownShiftSelector/DownShiftSelector.test.js:45:44)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

Given the code snippet above, the plug-in should generate the following output:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet _anonymousFnComponent, _anonymousFnComponent2\r\n\r\nexport default ({ data, sortComparator, filterPredicate, history }) => {\r\n  const transformedData = React.useMemo(() =>\r\n    data.filter(filterPredicate).sort(sortComparator)\r\n  , [data, data.filter, filterPredicate, sortComparator])\r\n\r\n  return React.createElement(_anonymousFnComponent2 = _anonymousFnComponent2 || (() => {\r\n    const _onClick2 = React.useCallback(() => history.pop(), [history, history.pop])\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <button className=\"back-btn\" onClick={_onClick2} />\r\n        <ul className=\"data-list\">\r\n          {transformedData.map(({ id, value }) =>\r\n            React.createElement(_anonymousFnComponent = _anonymousFnComponent || (() => {\r\n              const _onClick = React.useCallback(() =>\r\n                history.push(`data/${id}`)\r\n              , [history, history.push, id])\r\n\r\n              return (\r\n                <li className=\"data-item\" key={id} onClick={_onClick}>\r\n                  {value}\r\n                </li>\r\n              )\r\n            }), { key: id })\r\n          )}\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }), null)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plug-in will:\r\n\r\n- `useCallback()` automatically when a function is created.\r\n- `useMemo()` automatically when a value is assigned.\r\n- Will memoize inline callbacks.\r\n\r\nI don't see however how can `useEffect()` be inferred automatically and if it's a good idea. The plug-in is not a feature request directly for React, but since it's stated in the docs I thought maybe it can be useful somehow. Maybe it can potentially be included as part of `create-react-app`? Would like to hear your thoughts about it. An alternative solution is suggested at #14406, but I don't see why do this at runtime when everything can be done ahead of time and save processing power.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8-alpha (hooks)\r\n",

Thanks for your awesome work. I have a problem when using \r\n`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nMy example code like this:\r\n```\r\n//...  the node.topic is a string\r\nrender() {\r\n    const { node, className, style } = this.props;\r\n    return (\r\n      <div\r\n        tabIndex={0}\r\n        contentEditable={true}\r\n        id=\"editor\"\r\n        onKeyDown={this.handleKeyDown}\r\n        spellCheck={false}\r\n        onBlur={this.handleBlur}\r\n        onPaste={this.handlePaste}\r\n        ref={this.containerRef}\r\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: node.topic }}\r\n        style={style}\r\n      />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I got unexpected html that looks like\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13745971/51608727-3a28a680-1f53-11e9-9c6a-1b9161b63d67.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13745971/51608733-3eed5a80-1f53-11e9-8232-456034ce6e13.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt's hard for me to debug what's wrong with it. It's sometimes work, but sometimes will generate a `<br/>` tag. \r\nMaybe the `<br />` tag is generated by my browser ?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\nreact 16.7.0\r\nreact-dom 16.7.0\r\nOS: macos 10.14.1 Beta (18B73a)\r\nChrome: 71.0.3578.98\r\n```\r\n",

I am using the `onChange` synthetic event on this component.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine initially, but as soon as I use the input component, thus firing the `onChange` events, the application starts to lag. I went into the performance monitor in Chrome's DevTools and recorded a performance profile, and noticed that there is something weird happening to GC behaviour before and after the `onChange` events.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of Chrome Devtools performance monitor\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17537040/51691161-3f740880-1fc8-11e9-91a6-0067cd6d4304.png)\r\n\r\nIt seems like GC is working fine before the `onChange` events are fired, but once the events are fired, it changes its behaviour and does not show the \"zigzag\" pattern anymore. \r\n\r\nAnd this is precisely where the app starts lagging, and all function calls take much longer than before.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me understand what is going on here and how to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.",

To do this, I detect usage during `render()` by using Proxies, which can register all access. This data, in turn, is used to prevent needless re-renders.\r\n\r\nA parent component can pass a Proxy which represents a string, for example, to a child component, which, without knowing it is a Proxy, can use this value in a calculation (e.g. `props.value + 1` or `` `The value is ${props.value}` ``). This can be handled with `proxy[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`, which is called by JS automatically when used in this sort of expression.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work if the child now passes the proxy directly to React as a child:\r\n```jsx\r\n  return (<span>{this.props.childValue</span>);\r\n```\r\nReact will do a `typeof` on the child, find it is an object, and report `Objects are not valid as a React child`. Unfortunately, `typeof` cannot be spoofed with Proxy, and it will always return `'object'`.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189-L204). The alternative could be for React to check if there's a `child[Symbol.tpPrimitive]` and, if so, evaluate it to find the intended value, and to retry with this value as the child.\r\nIt could be as simple as inserting the following code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189):\r\n```js\r\n  if (typeof Symbol !== 'undefined') {\r\n    const toPrimitive = children[Symbol.toPrimitive];\r\n    if (toPrimitive) {\r\n      const value = toPrimitive('string');\r\n      if (typeof value !== 'object') {\r\n\t\treturn traverseAllChildrenImpl(\r\n\t\t  value,\r\n\t\t  nameSoFar,\r\n\t\t  callback,\r\n\t\t  traverseContext,\r\n\t\t)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if React would support this use-case. The alternative is for parent components to resolve the value, which would attribute the access to the parent component, instead of the child, where it's really being used. This in turn would cause the parent to be rerendered when only the child is being changed.\r\n\r\nIf the child is aware it may be receiving Proxy objects, it can resolve the value itself. However, the whole point of using Proxies is to automate all the refresh logic (like `shouldComponentUpdate`). Also, not needing to resolve the value would allow the value to propagate through to descendant components which may be wholly unaware of the proxy. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll version, never worked before.",

This relates to Hooks.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all expected behaviour and one of the workarounds mentioned is required.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a hook that depends on the `useContext` hook. Using it as follows works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyHookedComponent = () => {\r\n    const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n       //Do something with contextValue\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                <MyHookedComponent />\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to use the `getContext` hook inline in the same component that declares the `DemoContext.Provider` ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n       const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext); //Of course this fails due to the Context hierarchy.\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                     //Do something with contextValue\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI seem to be unable to get this working.\r\n\r\n**Please note**:\r\n- I have a very good reason for solving my issue with Context and not passing props.\r\n- The implementation I show above looks trivial and dumb but it is the simplest way to illustrate what the use case is. In my implementation the `Provider` sits in a complex component that does a lot of data management which I really want to happen at this level.\r\n- The usual way to use this will be the first working version I noted above, it is only in the case where the user would want to use the hook inline inside the `Provider`.\r\n- I have searched for a couple of hours and tried various configurations without success, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of another issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAny method to consume context inline in the provider using the same re-usable hook without having to revert back to render props.\r\n\r\nI know I can solve this with **render props** but I am trying to convert an implementation using render props to hooks. I also know I can hoist the Context Provider higher up but in my implementation it would quadruple the code complexity to develop and maintain while introducing extra complexity into the user interface.\r\n\r\nAlso, by extracting the body inside the `Provider` to a new component I can also solve this but ideally I would not like to have a user do this for this use case.\r\n",

Sometimes, that's exactly what's required: for example, a library like [react-pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/api/posed/#posed-usage-create-a-posed-component-existing-components) demands ref forwarding to work with a React Component, but you'd also like to retain a reference to the _same_ parent DOM node within that component itself for a different reason. It's often not possible to nest DOM nodes to achieve a similar thing using two different ref attributes as that breaks layout.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a naive attempt to achieve this: https://codesandbox.io/s/4jyw3q3v57\r\n\r\nI'm not surprised this doesn't work as there's no reason for the parent ref callback to fire, but I don't know how else to go about it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe callback provides the component with its own reference to the parent DOM node, whilst also providing it to the parent component via the passed `RefObject`.\r\n",

Bisecting the issue, it seemed to appear at commit 7bee9fbdd49aa5b9365a94b0ddf6db04bc1bf51c.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nOur apologies, we are unable to fully isolate the issue to a minimal demo, and suspect it is not a bug but a behavior change which our code relied on. The leak seems to be in the messages area, where many components are created and released quickly.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nOld fibers should be garbage collected, but cannot be. Components are retained in memory.\r\nWe have run the affected code area in StrictMode, which allowed us to identify some event leakage but even when this was addressed (by moving listeners to componentDidMount from the constructor) the memory leak continues. There are some findDomNode usages remaining, but even if we move those it does not fill the leak.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.5.3+\r\n\r\nWe are seeking suggestions on what internal could be causing retention of components and nodes by our code, and better ways to isolate the issue.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n-Mike",

I can achieve this using hooks as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst options = useMemo(() => {\r\n  // Calculate the options\r\n}, [dep1, dep2]);\r\n\r\nconst [choice, setChoice] = useState(options[0]);\r\n\r\nconst result = useMemo(() => {\r\n  // Calculate the displayed result\r\n}, [choice]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, a problem occurs if either `dep1` or `dep2` changes. The list of options changes, which means `choice` may no longer be valid. To fix this, I must split `choice` into a selected value and a memoized value that checks for validity:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [selectedChoice, setSelectedChoice] = useState(options[0]);\r\n\r\nconst choice = useMemo(() => {\r\n  if (options.includes(selectedChoice) {\r\n    return selectedChoice;\r\n  } else {\r\n    setSelectedChoice(options[0]);\r\n    return options[0];\r\n  }\r\n}, [options, selectedChoice]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt would useful if we could declare dependencies for `useState`, in the same way that we can for `useMemo`, and have the state reset back to the initial state if they change:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [choice, setChoice] = useState(options[0], [options]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to allow preserving the current value if its valid, React could supply `prevState` to the initial state factory function, if any exists, e.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [choice, setChoice] = useState(prevState => {\r\n  if (prevState && options.includes(prevState) {\r\n    return prevState;\r\n else {\r\n    return options[0];\r\n }\r\n}, [options]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Of course this was not an acceptable fix.\r\n\r\nThen, I realized that everything could be solved by just removing the wrapping `<Fragment>` in the return statement of DomainItem's `render` function. Now everything works fine:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nreturn this.props.availability === STATUS_AVAILABLE\r\n      ? <Fragment>\r\n        {discount}\r\n        {!this.props.isCoupon &&\r\n        <Tooltip\r\n          overlay={<span>First year, then ${this.props.renewalPrice} renewal. <RouterLink target='_blank' href='https://support.rebrandly.com/hc/en-us/articles/225551448-Domain-Pricing-for-Custom-Short-Urls'>Learn more</RouterLink></span>}\r\n          placement='top'\r\n        >\r\n          <Text className='DomainItem__azure m-r-24'>${this.props.currentPrice}</Text>\r\n        </Tooltip>\r\n        }\r\n        {this.state.isLoading\r\n          ? <Loading size='md' />\r\n          : <Button\r\n            isLoading={this.state.isLoading}\r\n            {...this.props.actionButtonProps}\r\n            onClick={this.handleOnClick}\r\n          />\r\n        }\r\n      </Fragment>\r\n      : <Text className='DomainItem__unavailable Text--SubDetail' size='small'>\r\n        {!!this.props.availability && (this.props.availability === STATUS_UNKNOWN ? 'Couldn‚Äôt check domain details' : 'Not available')}\r\n      </Text>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDidn't know if this is an intended behaviour so I thought it was worthy to report it.\r\n",

Those event listeners are triggering state updates (via `useState`). I think I have found a bug where simultaneous key events occurring in the same frame (whether down or up) will be handled out of order, causing state to becoming out of sync.\r\n\r\nTake the following simple app (https://codesandbox.io/s/1z3v9zrk4j). I've kept this as keyup only for simplicity.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [keys, setKeys] = useState([]);\r\n\r\n  console.log('App', keys);\r\n\r\n  const onKeyUp = function (event) {\r\n    console.log('onKeyUp', event.key, keys);\r\n\r\n    setKeys([...keys, event.key]);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(function () {\r\n    console.log('effect', keys);\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener('keyup', onKeyUp);\r\n\r\n    return function () {\r\n      console.log('removing event listener', keys);\r\n\r\n      window.removeEventListener('keyup', onKeyUp);\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return <p>{keys.join(', ')}</p>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I press down any two keys, e.g. the \"q\" and \"w\" keys, and then release them at precisely the same time, the following happens:\r\n\r\n- The `keyup` event listener for `w` is called, which in turn calls `setKeys` with `['w']`\r\n- `App` is re-rendered with `keys === ['w']`\r\n- The `keyup` event listener for `q` is called, which in turn calls `setKeys` with `['q']`\r\n- The effect's cleanup function is called, removing the event listener with `keys === []`\r\n- The effect is run again, the event listener being added with `keys === ['w']`\r\n- `App` is re-rendered with `keys === ['q']`\r\n- The effect's cleanup function is called, removing the event listener with `keys ===['w']`\r\n- The effect is run again, the event listener being added with `keys === ['q']`\r\n\r\nThis results in `keys === ['q']`. The render with `w` has been lost.\r\n\r\nWith three keys, only two keys are reliably shown. Four keys - only two are reliably shown.\r\n\r\nIf I add another `useState` call, the first `useState` has no issues - all keys are reliably detected. The second `useState` call has the same issue as the original example. See https://codesandbox.io/s/0yo51n5wv:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [keys, setKeys] = useState([]); // works\r\n  const [keysTwo, setKeysTwo] = useState([]); // does not work\r\n\r\n  console.log(\"rendering App\", keys);\r\n\r\n  const onKeyUp = function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"onKeyUp event received\", event.key, keys);\r\n\r\n    setKeys([...keys, event.key]);\r\n    setKeysTwo([...keysTwo, event.key]);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(function() {\r\n    console.log(\"adding event listener\", keys);\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(\"keyup\", onKeyUp);\r\n\r\n    return function() {\r\n      console.log(\"removing event listener\", keys);\r\n\r\n      window.removeEventListener(\"keyup\", onKeyUp);\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>Keyups received:</p>\r\n      <p>{keys.join(\", \")}</p>\r\n      <p>{keysTwo.join(\", \")}</p>\r\n      <button onClick={() => (setKeys([]), setKeysTwo([]))}>Reset</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect the final state array to contain all keys released, in order. There are a few workarounds for this issue (e.g. passing a function to `setState` to retrieve the current value instead of using the rendered value), but from the documentation it seems that is an escape hatch for use when the effect's callback is not renewed on each state change, and should not be necessary in this case (unless I've misunderstood).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIt happens on both versions that support hooks - `16.8.0-alpha.0` and `16.8.0-alpha.1`. This is on Chrome/Safari/Firefox on MacOS Mojave.\r\n",
